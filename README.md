[**OutDoor**](https://outdoor-vue.web.app/)

## Under Development
This is a project I began building through the early Corona quarantine time and still maintaining today.

Built with **VueJS** & **Vuetify**. Using **Firebase** for hosting & Real-Time database.

The [API](https://github.com/shahafss/outdoor-api) is not hosted yet so you won't be able to join/create a room.
but the user-authentication is still done through the Client so you should be able to sign up/login.

## About
OutDoor is a platform that helps you find people to join you in whatever activity you're planning.


Wether you're two players short for a Basketball game

or you want to join a group for a workout session

maybe you're just looking for someone to chill with by the beach.

* Create a room for your activity
* Set the time & place to meet up
* Wait for people to join you.

Or just browse through the existing rooms and join other people.

Enjoy! (:
